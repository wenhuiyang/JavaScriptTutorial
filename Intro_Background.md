JavaScript 

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. JavaScript is also used in environments that are not web-based, such as PDF documents. Newer and faster JavaScript virtual machines (VMs) and platforms built upon them have also increased the popularity of JavaScript for server-side web applications.


History 

In 1994, Netscape was founded to exploit the potential of the World Wide Web. Netscape realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Even if you simply wanted to check that users entered correct values in a form, you needed to send the data to a service in order to get feedback. This was the problem that was addressed by Brendan Eich who developed JavaScript.

JavaScript, not to be confused with Java, was created in 10 days in May 1995 by Brendan Eich who was working at Netscape and now Mozilla. JavaScript was originally named Mocha and changed to LiveScript a few month later. In December of 1995, the trademark license from Sun was received and name was changed to JavaScript. This was a marketing strategy because of the popularity of Java at that time.


Usage 

JavaScript is a prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative and functional programming styles.

JavaScript alongside HTML and CSS is one of the three essential technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by modern web browsers without plug-ins.
